  "meaning": "Cycle Detection in Directed Graph is taught here with its own state, transition, code trace, and stopping rule.",
  "problem": "Directed cycle detection uses a recursion stack to detect edges back into the active DFS path.",
  "concept": "Cycle Detection in Directed Graph is useful when stack behavior is the clearest model for the data changes. Use this when the problem is naturally described by last-in, first-out state.",
  "logicSummary": "Read the next value or operation, maintain last-in, first-out state, then push, pop, peek, or resolve stack entries.",
  "transitionSummary": "Each step changes only the part of the stack required to preserve the invariant.",
  "codeInsight": "The code keeps visited, distance, parent, indegree, or component state explicit so it is not confused with another graph routine.",
  "realLifeExample": "Use this graph routine when the problem's required result matches its traversal, shortest path, ordering, or connectivity invariant.",
  "whenToUse": "Use it when the graph input and required output match this algorithm's invariant.",
  "memoryTrick": "Cycle Detection in Directed Graph: name the invariant, then trace the exact state change.",
  "visualizerCaption": "Cycle Detection in Directed Graph is shown as stack state changes. The numbered steps follow the code path used to maintain the main invariant.",
