  "realLifeExample": "Think of this page as the isolated practice bench for Upper Bound: inputs come in, key state changes are tracked, and the result is produced step by step.",
  "whenToUse": "Use Upper Bound when a problem statement matches the Searching pattern and the planned visualization is array boundaries.",
  "memoryTrick": "Upper Bound: name the state, update it once per step, and check the stop condition before returning.",
