  "meaning": "Diagonal Matrix shows how data is organized, changed, and inspected through a small browser demo with a C/C++ reference available beside it.",
  "problem": "Diagonal Matrix explains the matrix state model and how one focused change updates it.",
  "concept": "Grid algorithms are useful when positions, neighbors, boundaries, or cell states define the problem. Use this when the answer depends on moving through rows, columns, or regions.",
  "logicSummary": "Read dimensions, choose the active cell or boundary, update neighbors or accumulated state, and return the grid result.",
  "transitionSummary": "Each step moves to a valid cell, changes a boundary, or updates a matrix state.",
  "codeInsight": "Use the Runnable JS tab to edit inputs and see browser-safe output. Use the C/C++ Reference tab to study the source implementation.",
  "originalCodeInsight": "The loop is the transition: it repeatedly visits elements or nodes and updates the structure state.",
  "realLifeExample": "Diagonal Matrix is useful when you need to understand the mechanics behind library-level data structures.",
  "whenToUse": "Use this page when learning Matrix / Sparse Matrix / Polynomial behavior through state changes instead of memorized code.",
  "memoryTrick": "Diagonal Matrix: name the invariant, then trace the exact state change.",
