  "meaning": "Recursion Factorial shows how data is organized, changed, and inspected through a small browser demo with the original C/C++ reference available beside it.",
  "problem": "Recursion Factorial explains the recursive call state model and how one focused change updates it.",
  "concept": "Data structures are easier to learn when each value has a clear place and every change preserves a rule.",
  "logicSummary": "Track the active state, enter a call, reach a base case, then unwind, and inspect the updated view.",
  "transitionSummary": "Move one step forward by changing only the slots, links, cursors, or nodes required by this operation.",
  "codeInsight": "Use the Runnable JS tab to edit inputs and see browser-safe output. Use the Original C/C++ tab to study the source implementation.",
  "originalCodeInsight": "The loop is the transition: it repeatedly visits elements or nodes and updates the structure state.",
