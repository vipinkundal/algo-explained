  "meaning": "First Recursion Program shows how data is organized, changed, and inspected through a small browser demo with a C/C++ reference available beside it.",
  "problem": "First Recursion Program explains the recursive call state model and how one focused change updates it.",
  "concept": "First Recursion Program is useful when stack behavior is the clearest model for the data changes. Use this when the problem is naturally described by last-in, first-out state.",
  "logicSummary": "Read the next value or operation, maintain last-in, first-out state, then push, pop, peek, or resolve stack entries.",
  "transitionSummary": "Each step changes only the part of the stack required to preserve the invariant.",
  "codeInsight": "Use the Runnable JS tab to edit inputs and see browser-safe output. Use the C/C++ Reference tab to study the source implementation.",
  "originalCodeInsight": "The C/C++ reference First Recursion Program source shows the C/C++ memory model and operation order used by this lesson.",
  "realLifeExample": "First Recursion Program is useful when you need to understand the mechanics behind library-level data structures.",
  "whenToUse": "Use this page when learning Recursion behavior through state changes instead of memorized code.",
  "memoryTrick": "First Recursion Program: name the invariant, then trace the exact state change.",
