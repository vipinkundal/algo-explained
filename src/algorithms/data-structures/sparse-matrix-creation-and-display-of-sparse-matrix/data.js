  "problem": "Creation And Display Of Sparse Matrix explains the matrix state model and how one focused change updates it.",
  "concept": "Grid algorithms are useful when positions, neighbors, boundaries, or cell states define the problem. Use this when the answer depends on moving through rows, columns, or regions.",
  "logicSummary": "Read dimensions, choose the active cell or boundary, update neighbors or accumulated state, and return the grid result.",
  "transitionSummary": "Each step moves to a valid cell, changes a boundary, or updates a matrix state.",
  "codeInsight": "Use the Runnable JS tab to edit inputs and see browser-safe output. Use the C/C++ Reference tab to study the source implementation.",
  "originalCodeInsight": "Dynamic allocation creates storage at runtime; every pointer assignment changes how nodes or arrays are connected.",
