  "realLifeExample": "Think of this page as the isolated practice bench for DP on Trees: inputs come in, key state changes are tracked, and the result is produced step by step.",
  "whenToUse": "Use DP on Trees when a problem statement matches the Dynamic Programming pattern and the planned visualization is tree dp.",
