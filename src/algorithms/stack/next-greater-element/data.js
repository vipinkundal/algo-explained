  "meaning": "Next Greater Element is taught here with its own state, transition, code trace, and stopping rule.",
  "problem": "Next Greater Element uses a decreasing stack to resolve values when a larger value appears.",
  "concept": "Next Greater Element is useful when stack behavior is the clearest model for the data changes. Use this when the problem is naturally described by last-in, first-out state.",
  "logicSummary": "Read the next value or operation, maintain last-in, first-out state, then push, pop, peek, or resolve stack entries.",
  "transitionSummary": "Each step changes only the part of the stack required to preserve the invariant.",
  "codeInsight": "The implementation names the backing state directly, so the code trace matches the visual data structure on the page.",
  "realLifeExample": "Next Greater Element appears when the problem is defined by the behavior of this exact data structure.",
  "whenToUse": "Use Next Greater Element when its state transition is the natural way to model the problem.",
  "memoryTrick": "Next Greater Element: name the invariant, then trace the exact state change.",
  "visualizerCaption": "Next Greater Element is shown as stack state changes. The numbered steps follow the code path used to maintain the main invariant.",
